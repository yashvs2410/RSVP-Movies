 To begin with, it is beneficial to know the shape of the tables and whether any column has null values.
 Further in this segment, you will take a look at 'movies' and 'genre' tables.*/



-- Segment 1:




-- Q1. Find the total number of rows in each table of the schema?
-- Type your code below:

select count(*) from movie;
select count(*) from genre;
select count(*) from director_mapping;
select count(*) from role_mapping;
select count(*) from names;
select count(*) from ratings;


-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:

select (select count(*) from movie where id IS NULL) as ID, 
(select count(*) from movie where title IS NULL) as TITLE,
(select count(*) from movie where year IS NULL) as YEAR,
(select count(*) from movie where date_published IS NULL) as DATE,
(select count(*) from movie where duration IS NULL) as DURATION,
(select count(*) from movie where country IS NULL) as COUNTRY,
(select count(*) from movie where worlwide_gross_income IS NULL) as INCOME,
(select count(*) from movie where languages IS NULL) as LANGUAGES,
(select count(*) from movie where production_company IS NULL) as COMPANY;

-- Now as you can see four columns of the movie table has null values. Let's look at the at the movies released each year. 
-- Q3. Find the total number of movies released each year? How does the trend look month wise? (Output expected)

-- Type your code below:
